- :bangbang: I am interested in event logging, endpoint security, and advancing SIEM capabilities for large networks. I am currently developing malware correlations using Splunk and learning R for statstical analysis. This page will be used for uploading artifacts for reproducibility/replicability experiments and studies, and as a resource for others to build on for SIEM and malware studies.
